**What I Know About Bloomberg Terminal and Why It's Different**

---

## 🎯 **What is Bloomberg Terminal?**

The **Bloomberg Terminal** (often called "the Bloomberg" or "BT") is the **most powerful and expensive financial data platform** in the world. Launched in **1982** by Michael Bloomberg, it's the weapon of choice for:

- **Portfolio managers** ($100M+ portfolios)
- **Professional traders** (Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Citadel)
- **Financial analysts** (equity research, credit research)
- **Central banks** and government institutions

Think of it as **"MS-DOS for finance nerds"** - a black-screen command-line interface that gives you **God-mode access** to the entire financial universe.

## 🤔 **Why Bloomberg Still Dominates (Despite Your System)**

**Example:**
- You want to buy $50M in corporate bonds
- You message 10 dealers on **Bloomberg IB**
- They send quotes via chat (binding)
- Trade happens in **2 minutes**
- No Bloomberg? No trade.

### **The Switching Cost**

**Why firms don't cancel Bloomberg:**
- Traders have **muscle memory** (20,000 commands)
- Re-training entire team = **$500k+ cost**
- Lose access to **Bloomberg network** (career death)
- Compliance systems **require** Bloomberg message archiving
- Data feeds **incompatible** with other platforms
