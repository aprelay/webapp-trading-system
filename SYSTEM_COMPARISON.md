## 🎯 RECOMMENDED STRATEGY: Use BOTH!

### **The Professional Approach:**

#### **Morning (08:00-09:00 UTC):**
```
1. Run 15M Auto-Generator
   ↓
   Get big-picture view:
   - Are we bullish or bearish overall?
   - Which timeframes are aligned?
   - What's the weekly trend?
   
2. Let 5M-Assassin run (already running 24/7)
   ↓
   Wait for A-grade alerts:
   - Only trade in direction of big picture
   - Filter signals: BUY if 15M is bullish
   - Skip counter-trend trades
   
3. Execute when BOTH agree
   ↓
   Maximum conviction trades:
   - 15M: Bullish (5 TF aligned)
   - 5M: A-grade BUY signal
   - Result: HIGH PROBABILITY setup
```

#### **During Day (Trading Hours):**
```
1. Monitor 5M-Assassin alerts (passive)
2. Execute only aligned trades:
   - If 15M said BUY → Take only 5M BUY signals
   - If 15M said SELL → Take only 5M SELL signals
   - Ignore counter-trend signals
```

#### **Evening (20:00-21:00 UTC):**
```
1. Run 15M Auto-Generator again
2. Review:
   - Did trend change?
   - Are timeframes still aligned?
   - Need to adjust bias tomorrow?
3. Plan next day's strategy
```

## 🏆 PRO TIPS FOR COMBINING BOTH

### **Tip 1: Morning Bias → Intraday Filter**
```
Morning (15M):       Get bias (bullish/bearish/neutral)
During Day (5M):     Execute ONLY aligned signals
Result:              70-80% win rate (vs 50-60% random)
```

### **Tip 2: Score + Alignment = Conviction**
```
High Conviction:
├─ 15M: 80%+ alignment ✅
├─ 5M: A-grade (144+ pts) ✅
└─ Execute: FULL position (1%)

Medium Conviction:
├─ 15M: 60-79% alignment ⚠️
├─ 5M: A-grade ✅
└─ Execute: HALF position (0.5%)

Low Conviction:
├─ 15M: <60% alignment ❌
├─ OR 5M: B/C-grade ❌
└─ Skip: WAIT FOR BETTER
```

### **Tip 3: Reversal Detection**
```
If 5M gives opposite signal to 15M:
├─ Example: 15M bullish, but 5M gives A-grade SELL
├─ Don't execute immediately
├─ Re-run 15M Generator
├─ If 15M confirms reversal → TAKE IT
├─ If 15M still bullish → SKIP (false signal)
```

### **Tip 4: Weekend Planning**
```
Sunday Evening:
├─ Run 15M Generator
├─ Check weekly trend (4h + daily)
├─ Set bias for Monday-Friday
├─ Mark key levels on chart
└─ Plan: "This week I'm looking for BUY setups"

Monday-Friday:
├─ 5M alerts come in
├─ Filter: Only BUYs (if weekly bullish)
├─ Execute best setups
└─ Avoid counter-trend noise
```
